	    							<p style="text-align: justify">In the past few years I worked on different aspects of cosmology and structure formation, 
	    							all linked by my interest in computational astrophysics and in how numerical simulations and 
	    							theoretical predictions can be compared to observational results. In particular, I see gravitational 
	    							lensing as a natural observational counterpart of my computational work, since it is a powerful tool 
	    							to trace the mass distribution of galaxies, offering us a way to “see” the dark matter distribution. 
	    							I run and analyse numerical simulations with different dark matter models - including CDM, WDM and 
	    							SIDM - and state-of-the-art baryonic physics. My work includes a detailed parametrisation of halo 
	    							properties in all these different scenarios and the comparison with gravitational lensing observations, 
	    							through realistic mock images.</p>

    								<p style="text-align: justify"> Numerical simulations play a central role in testing dark matter models: cosmological and galaxy 
    								formation simulations run with different physical models allow us to make prediction on the abundance 
    								and spatial distribution of dark matter haloes and the galaxies they host, which can then be compared 
    								with observational data. For this purpose, we need both large scale and high-resolution re-simulations: 
    								in the formers, the galaxy formation model can be tested against observables such as the galaxy stellar 
    								mass function and we can calculate the number density of dark matter haloes that could act as a lens or 
    								as a line-of-sight perturber; since the possible resolution of these simulations is limited by the 
    								computational resources, higher resolution re-simulations of individual haloes can tell us more on the 
    								satellite distribution and can be used to generate realistic mock images. </p>

									<p style="text-align: justify">In particular, a very promising way of testing dark matter models is substructure lensing, in which 
									low mass dark perturber are detected as surface brightness perturbations in gravitational arcs. A fundamental

									while their abundance is lower in alternative models, such as warm or self- interacting dark matter. 
									Confirming or not the existence of such objects is one of the most important empirical tests for dark matter. 
									While current lensing data are available in limited number and allow to detect objects of mass ~ 10^9 M☉, 
									future observational campaign will lead to an increase in the sample size (DES, LSST, Euclid) and resolution

												<h3>Updated predictions for CDM vs SIDM in elliptical galaxies</h3>
											</header>
											<p style="text-align: justify"> We study the effect of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and baryons on the shapes of 
											  early-type galaxies (ETGs) and their dark matter haloes, comparing them to the predictions of the standard cold dark 
											  matter (CDM) scenario. We use a sample of five zoom-in simulations of haloes hosting ETGs ($M_{\text vir}\sim 10^{13}M_{\odot}$ 
											  and $M_{*}\sim10^{11}M_{\odot}$), simulated in CDM and a SIDM model with constant cross-section of $\sigma_T/m_\chi = 1\ \mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{g}^{-1}$, 
											  with and without the inclusion of baryonic physics. We measure the three-dimensional and projected shapes of the dark matter 
											  haloes and their baryonic content by means of the inertia tensor and compare our measurements to the results of gravitational 
											  lensing and X-ray observations. We find that the inclusion of baryons greatly reduces the differences between CDM and a SIDM and 
											  thus the ability to draw constraints on the basis of shapes. We find that lensing measurements clearly reject the predictions from 
											  CDM dark-matter-only simulations, whereas they show a different degree of preference for the CDM and SIDM hydro scenarios, and 
											  cannot discard the SIDM dark-matter-only case. The shapes of the X-ray emitting gas are also comparable to observational results 
											  in both hydro runs, with CDM predicting higher elongations only in the very center. Contrary to previous claims at the scale of 
											  elliptical galaxies, we conclude that both CDM and our SIDM model with $\sigma_T/m_\chi = 1\ \mathrm{cm}^2 \mathrm{g}^{-1}$ are 
											  able to explain observed distributions of halo shapes, once baryons are included in the simulations. </p>

												<h3>Detailed sensitivity maps to detect low-mass haloes</h3>
											</header>
											<p style="text-align: justify"> This paper aims to quantify how the lowest halo mass that can be detected 
											with galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lensing depends on the quality of the observations and the characteristics 
											of the observed lens systems. Using simulated data, we measure the lowest detectable NFW mass at each location of 
											the lens plane, in the form of detailed sensitivity maps. In summary, we find that: (i) the lowest detectable mass 
											Mlow decreases linearly as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases and the sensitive area is larger when we 
											decrease the noise; (ii) a moderate increase in angular resolution (0.07" vs 0.09") and pixel scale (0.01" vs 0.04") 
											improves the sensitivity by on average 0.25 dex in halo mass, with more significant improvement around the most 
											sensitive regions; (iii) the sensitivity to low-mass objects is largest for bright and complex lensed galaxies located 
											inside the caustic curves and lensed into larger Einstein rings (i.e rE ≥ 1.0″). We find that for the sensitive mock 
											images considered in this work, the minimum mass that we can detect at the redshift of the lens lies between 1.5 × 108 
											and 3 × 109M⊙. We derive analytic relations between Mlow, the SNR and resolution and discuss the impact of the lensing 
											configuration and source structure. Our results start to fill the gap between approximate predictions and real data and 
											demonstrate the challenging nature of calculating precise forecasts for gravitational imaging. In light of our findings, 
											we discuss possible strategies for designing strong lensing surveys and the prospects for HST, Keck, ALMA, Euclid and 
											other future observations. </p>

												<h3>Modelling the line-of-sight contribution in substructure lensing</h3>
											</header>	
     										<p style="text-align: justify"> We investigate how Einstein rings and magnified arcs are affected by small-mass dark-matter haloes 
     										placed along the line of sight to gravitational lens systems. By comparing the gravitational signature 
     										of line-of-sight haloes with that of substructures within the lensing galaxy, we derive a mass-redshift 
     										relation that allows us to rescale the detection threshold (i.e. lowest detectable mass) for substructures 
     										to a detection threshold for line-of-sight haloes at any redshift. We then quantify the line-of-sight 
     										contribution to the total number density of low-mass objects that can be detected through strong gravitational 
     										lensing. Finally, we assess the degeneracy between substructures and line-of-sight haloes of different mass 
     										and redshift to provide a statistical interpretation of current and future detections, with the aim of 
     										distinguishing between cold dark matter and warm dark matter. We find that line-of-sight haloes statistically 
     										dominate with respect to substructures, by an amount that strongly depends on the source and lens redshifts, 
     										and on the chosen dark-matter model. Substructures represent about 30 percent of the total number of perturbers 
     										for low lens and source redshifts (as for the SLACS lenses), but less than 10 per cent for high-redshift systems. 
     										We also find that for data with high enough signal-to-noise ratio and angular resolution, the non-linear effects 
     										arising from a double-lens-plane configuration are such that one is able to observationally recover the line-of-sight 
     										halo redshift with an absolute error precision of 0.15 at the 68 per cent confidence level.</p>

												<h3>The interplay of self-interacting dark matter and baryons</h3>
											</header>
											<p style="text-align: justify"> We use high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation to test the difference of halo properties in cold dark 
											matter (CDM) and a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) scenario with a constant cross-section of σT/mχ = 1 cm2 g-1. 
											We find that the interplay between dark matter self-interaction and baryonic physics induces a complex evolution of 
											the halo properties, which depends on the halo mass and morphological type, as well as on the halo mass accretion 
											history. While high-mass haloes, selected as analogues of early-type galaxies, show cored profiles in the SIDM run, 
											systems of intermediate mass and with a significant disc component can develop a profile that is similar or cuspier 
											than in CDM. The final properties of SIDM haloes - measured at z = 0.2 - correlate with the halo concentration and 
											formation time, suggesting that the differences between different systems are due to the fact that we are observing 
											the impact of self-interaction. We also search for signatures of SIDM in the lensing signal of the main haloes and 
											find hints of potential differences in the distribution of Einstein radii, which suggests that future wide-field 
											survey might be able to distinguish between CDM and SIDM models on this basis. Finally, we find that the subhalo 
											abundances are not altered in the adopted SIDM model with respect to CDM. </p>

												<h3>The impact of baryonic physics on subhaloes</h3>
											</header>
     										<p style="text-align: justify">We investigate the impact of baryonic physics on the subhalo population by analysing the results of two recent 
     										hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE and Illustris), which have very similar configuration, but a different model of 
     										baryonic physics. We concentrate on haloes with a mass between 10^12.5 and 10^14 M☉/h and redshift between 0.2 and 
     										0.5, comparing with observational results and subhalo detections in early-type galaxy lenses. We compare the number 
     										and the spatial distribution of subhaloes in the fully hydro runs and in their dark-matter-only (DMO) counterparts, 
     										focusing on the differences between the two simulations. We find that the presence of baryons reduces the number of 
     										subhaloes, especially at the low-mass end (≤1010 M☉ h-1), by different amounts depending on the model. The variations 
     										in the subhalo mass function are strongly dependent on those in the halo mass function, which is shifted by the effect 
     										of stellar and AGN feedback. Finally, we search for analogues of the observed lenses (Sloan Lens ACS) in the simulations, 
     										selecting them in velocity dispersion and dynamical properties. We use the selected galaxies to quantify detection 
     										expectations based on the subhalo populations in the different simulations, calculating the detection probability and 
     										the predicted values for the projected dark matter fraction in subhaloes fDM and the slope of the mass function α. 
     										We compare these values with those derived from subhalo detections in observations and conclude that the DMO and hydro 
     										EAGLE runs are both compatible with observational results, while results from the hydro Illustris run do not lie within the errors. </p>

												<h3>Substructure lensing  in sterile neutrino cosmologies</h3>
											</header>
      										<p style="text-align: justify">We use high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations run with the EAGLE model of galaxy formation to 
      										study the differences between the properties of - and subsequently the lensing signal from - subhaloes 
      										of massive elliptical galaxies at redshift 0.2, in Cold and Sterile Neutrino (SN) Dark matter models. 
      										We focus on the two 7 keV SN models that bracket the range of matter power spectra compatible with 
      										resonantly-produced SN as the source of the observed 3.5 keV line. We derive an accurate parametrisation 
      										for the subhalo mass function in these two SN models relative to CDM, as well as the subhalo spatial 
      										distribution, density profile, and projected number density and the dark matter fraction in subhaloes. 
      										We create mock lensing maps from the simulated haloes to study the differences in the lensing signal in 
      										the framework of subhalo detection. We find that  subhalo convergence is well described by a log-normal 
      										distribution and that signal of subhaloes in the power spectrum is lower in SN models with respect to CDM, 
      										at a level of 10 to 80 per cent, depending on the scale. However, the scatter between different projections 
      										is large and might make the use of power-spectrum studies on the typical scales of current lensing images 
      										very difficult. Moreover, in the framework of individual detections through gravitational imaging a sample 
      										of ~30 lenses with an average sensitivity of M_sub=5 x 10^7 M☉ would be required to discriminate between 
      										CDM and the considered sterile neutrino models. </p>

												<h3>The universality of the virial halo mass function</h3>
											</header>
      										<p style="text-align: justify">The abundance of galaxy clusters can constrain both the geometry and structure growth in our Universe. 
      										However, this probe could be significantly complicated by recent claims of nonuniversality in the halo mass 
      										function – non-trivial dependences with respect to the cosmological model and redshift. In this work we analyse 
      										the dependance of the mass function on the way haloes are identified and establish if this can cause departures 
      										from universality. In order to explore this, we use a set of different dark-matter-only cosmological simulations 
      										(Le SBARBINE simulations) adopting the cosmological parameters from the latest analysis of the Planck satellite’s 
      										data. This suite of simulations is complemented by a lower resolution set carried out with different cosmological 
      										parameters. We identify dark matter haloes using a Spherical Overdensity algorithm with varying overdensity thresholds 
      										(virial, 2000rho_c, 1000rho_c, 500rho_c, 200rho_c and 200rho_b) at several redshifts. We notice that previous claims 
      										of nonuniversality largely orginate from a pseudo-evolution of the mass function. When expressed in terms of the 
      										rescaled variable ⌫, the mass function for virial haloes is universal at the 5-10 % level, over the whole range of 
      										redshifts and cosmologies explored here. For every other overdensity considered, the departures of universailty are 
      										significantly larger, reaching 60% in some cases. We provide fitting functions for the halo mass function parameters 
      										as a function of density which predict, with a few percent accuracy, the halo mass function for a wide range of halo 
      										definitions, redshifts and cosmological models. We then present how the departures from universality associated with 
      										other halo definitions can be derived by combining the universality of the virial definition with the expected shape 
      										of the density profile of dark matter halos. </p>
